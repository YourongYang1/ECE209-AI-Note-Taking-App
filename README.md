# Jottre

Simple and minimalistic handwriting app for iPadOS (and iOS, macOS).

At the moment the full version of Jottre only supports iPadOS. This means that 'Jottre for iPhone' and 'Jottre for Mac' are intended as read-only applications.



## Features

- Builds on the powerful PencilKit framework (iPadOS only)
- iCloud documents synchronization
- Support for dark and light mode
- Minimalistic design



## Update 1.5

- Added support for multi-window

## Known issues

- [x] Drawings are not rendered in the correct userInterfaceStyle (when starting the app)
- [x] iCloud synchronization is not fast enough (documents are not uploaded directly)
- [x] Animation of CollectionViewCells (Deleting, Inserting...) not implemented
- [x] Deleting items takes too much time
- [x] If removing items from collectionview, certain thumbnails were not shown correctly
- [x] Changing the userInterface style will not affect upcoming application-scenes
- [x] As the ViewControllers widths shrunk the PencilKit Toolbar removes the forward/backwards button
